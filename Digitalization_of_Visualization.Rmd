# Now Entering the World of Digital Visualization

## Digital Visualizations Vs Digital Production

* Two Approaches Enter, One Approach Leaves
* Digital Visualizations are inherently Digitally Produced
* Not just digital producing static assets
	+ e.g. digital printing has helped with late stage customization
	+ think type setting vs. printers as we know them now
* Digital Production has it's pitfalls
	+ Where we need to remember our design principles
* Digital Visualizations have more capabilities/advantages
	+ Requires viewing on a digital medium
	+ Sets the stage for reproducibility, traceability, automatic updates

## The Digital Triad of Power

* Static Viz
* Interactive Viz
* Motion Viz

# Static Digital Visualizations

## Digital Job Aids and 3D Projections

# Interactive Visualizations

# Motion Visualizations

# Combined and Beyond

# Benefits

## Analytical Benefits

* Faster, better information
* Large brain, small attention capacity

## Compliance benefits

Sets the stage (not inherent) for
* Reproducible research and reports
* Automated or real time updates
* Traceability

# Conclusion

## Remember
* To Use Design Principles
* There is a universe beyond Excel
* Move beyond just digital versions of analog visualizations
